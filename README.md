As part of my studies at ECE, my team and I worked on a game in Unity aimed at improving user interaction in virtual environments. 
We used Unity to create virtual objects and integrated Leap Motion and the Phantom Omni haptic device to enable basic tactile interactions.
The project was developed using C, exploring ways to combine visual and haptic feedback for a more immersive experience.
